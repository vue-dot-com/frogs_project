TODO: 
1) Edit markdown text in order to describe what is shown in the code sections.
2) As litoria fallax species seems to be more present in coastal areas, those areas should be the focus. Land areas have a very minimal probability to host litoria fallax species.
3) The relation between the predictors and the response variable should be assessed in order to cut-off the useless variables. Try with random forest and assess gini or entropy scores.
4) Predictors should be scaled as most are skewed.
